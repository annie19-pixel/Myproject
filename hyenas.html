                    <p>There are two species of hyenas in Kenya-the striped hyena and the spotted hyena.<br>
                    They can be found throughout Africa, in all habitats except for rainforests.</p>
                    <p>The spotted hyena/ also called the laughing hyena) is the largest hyena species, with the <br>
                    females veing larger than the males.Their coats are patterned with dark spots. These<br>
                animals hunt fish, birds, and even hippo calves, and can work in packs to take<br>
            down wildbeasts or antelopes. </p>
            <p>Striped hyenas are lesser known than their spotted cousins. They are more scavengers<br>
            than hunters and typically come ot at night to feed on carcasses left by other animals.</p>
            <p>The spotted hyena is listed by the IUCN as leats concern, and the striped hyena is near<br>
            threatened. Human-wildlife conflict is the main threat to their survival.</p>
