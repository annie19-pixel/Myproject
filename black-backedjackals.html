                            <p>The black-backed jackal is a member of the dog family. It has a rusty red coat with a <br>
                            black patch on its back and a black-tipped tail. It measure around 95 centimeters(37<br>
                        inches) from head to tail.</p>
                        <p>As opportunistic omnivores, jackals eat they can. They work in family packs to <br>
                        hunt small antelopes, but they'll also feed on reptiles, insects, birds, fruits, berries, and <br>carcasses
                         left by larger predators.</p>
                         <p>Ther are two distinct populations of black-backed jackals in Africa-one in East africa<br>,
                        in countries including Kenya, Ethiopia, and Tanzania, and one in southern Africa, in<br>
                    counries including Namibia, Angola, and South Africa.</p>
                    <p>These animals live in a wide variety of habitats, from deserts to grasslands to savannahs.<br>
                    The IUCN lists black-backed jackals as least concern, meaning they face few threats.<br>
                However they are hunted by farmers who kill then to protect their livestock.</p>
