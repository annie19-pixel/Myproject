                    <p>One of the most recognizable animals in Kenya is the cheetah. These spotty cats-each<br>
                    with their own unique patterns- are skilled hunters, in part because of their natural<br>
                speed and agility. In fact, chaetahs are the fastest mammals on earth. They can accelerate<br>
            from zero to 60 miles per hour in just three seconds. Another interesting cheetah fact?<br>
        Unlike lions, tigers, jaguars, and leopards, cheetahs can't roar they on√¶y purr.</p>
        <p>These cats live and hunt in open grasslands across Africa.They can be found in<br>
        countries including Kenya, Algeria, South Africa and Niger.</p>
        <p>The international Union for the conservation of Nature (IUCN) classes cheetahs<br>
        as vulnerable. This means the species is at high risk of extinction in the wild. There are<br>
    just 6,517 mature cheetahs left in the wild, and their population is decreasing. Cheetahs are<br>
at a particular risk from habitat loss because they need such large range.Most cheetahs<br>
live in unprotected areas, where they come into conflict with farmers.</p>
