                        <p>The Afican savannah elephant is the world's largest land mammal.It lives across many<br>
                        differnet habitats, inluding open savannahs, deserts, and forests.As these animals roam,<br>
                    they play an omportant role within their ecosystems.They disperse seedsthrough their <br>
                dung, helping to fertilise the land; they clear paths through vegetation and overgrown<br> 
            bush, promoting plant diversity; and they use their tusks and feet to access water in dry <br>
        riverbeds, creating small watering holes for other animals.</p>
        <p>African savannah elephants are found in 23 countries across Africa.They have large <br>
        populations in Kenya, Botswana, Namibia, Tanzania, South Africa, Zambia,and <br>
    Zimbabwe.</p>
    <p>The IUCN classifies African savannah elephants as endangered.This means it is at a <br>
    very high risk of extinction in the wild. Their numbers are also decreasing.These <br>
elephants are poached for their ivory and their natural habitats are being converted into <br>
agricultural land and infrastructer by expanding human populations.</p>
<p>IFAW is working to protect Afriacn savannah elephants and conserve their remaining <br>
habitat through our Roon to Roam initiative.</p>
