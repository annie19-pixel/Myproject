                            <p>The dik-dik is a type of dwarf antelope that lives in arid regions of East Africa.They can<br>
                            live in such barren environments because they get water from the vegetation they eat.<br>
                        They also take cover in undergrowth to protect themselves from predators, including
                    eagles and cats.</p>
                    <p>There are four species of dik-diks, but just two of them live in Kenya. These include<br>
                    Guenthers's dik-dik and kirk's dik-dik. Kirk's is the largest dik-dik, though it's still small <br>in comparison to other antelopes. It stands at just 45 centimeters(18 inches) tall and<br>
                weighs only 7.2.kilograms (15.8)pounds. Guenther's dik-dik is the samllest but has an longer snout.</p>
                <p>The IUCN lists both Kirk's and Guenther's dik-diks as leat concern, though they are <br>
                    threatened by expanding agricultural settlements and exessive hunting in soem areas.</p>
