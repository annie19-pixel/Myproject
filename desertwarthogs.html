                    <p>The desert warthog is a mener of the pig family. It has a large, warty head, a coarse<br>
                    mane, and two pairs of tusks.Unlike the common warthog, which can be found across<br>
                most of Africa, the desert warthog only lives in Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia. It lives in savannah and shrubland habitats, where it feeds on grass and other vegetation and uses<br>
            abandoned aardvark burrows as a place to shelter.</p>
            <p>The desert warthog is listed by the IUCN as least consern.However, the population faces<br>
            several risks in Kenya, including growing human and livestock numbers. This increases <br>
            competition for both water and food.</p>
